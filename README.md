PhpMarshaller
=============

One day this will be a nice general purpose set of marshalling libraries along the same lines as Jackson and JAXB. But
 for PHP.

Today is not that day.

Currently the JSON implementation mostly works, and is configured using "annotations." A lot of functionality is completely untested.

This is in serious need of tests, and there's a load of TODO items.
The logger is a complete joke.
There's no XML implementation yet.
There is no documentation.
The only example of this being used is in a private repo.
