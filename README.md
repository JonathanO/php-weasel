PhpMarshaller
=============

One day this will be a nice general purpose set of marshalling libraries along the same lines as Jackson and JAXB. But
written for PHP.

Today is not that day.

This is in serious need of tests, there's a load of TODO items.
There's no XML implementation yet.
Blah, blah, etc.
