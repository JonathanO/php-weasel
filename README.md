PhpMarshaller
=============

One day this will be a nice general purpose set of marshalling libraries along the same lines as Jackson and JAXB. But
written for PHP.

Today is not that day.

Currently PhpAnnotation is probably mostly complete, providing a general "annotation" parsing library. I'm not 100%
happy with the design.
