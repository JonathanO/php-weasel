PhpMarshaller
=============

One day this will be a nice general purpose set of marshalling libraries along the same lines as Jackson and JAXB. But
written for PHP.

Today is not that day.

This is in serious need of tests, and there's a load of TODO items.
The logger is a complete joke.
There's no XML implementation yet.
